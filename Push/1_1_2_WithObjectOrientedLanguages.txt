“Favor object composition 
over class inheritance.”
    ~ The Gang of Four, 
“Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software” c.1994

Class inheritance creates 
    parent/child object taxonomies 
    as a side-effect.
        . . . when you use class inheritance, 
        you buy into 
        the whole existing class taxonomy."
                        -- Eric Elliott ...

                            Prototypal Inheritance? 


“…the problem with object-oriented languages is 
they’ve got all this implicit environment 
that they carry around with them. 
You wanted a banana but what you got 
was a gorilla holding the banana 
    and the entire jungle.”
