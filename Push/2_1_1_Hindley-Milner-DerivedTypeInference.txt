ML derived type inference makes provides the "feel" dynamic typing
    But:
    The strong-static typing,
    supercharges compiler optimization
    A concision that is on par with Ruby, 
    but an execution that is at least as fast as Java, 
    (see benchmarks).

Hindley-Milner derived types offer, provability.
  
Complexity is constrained & Parallelization is made easier.
