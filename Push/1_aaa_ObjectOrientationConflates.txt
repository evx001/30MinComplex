Object Orientation conflates:
    identity
    value
    and state;
        once munged; it doesn't un-munge easily 
    it attempts to control 
    data and state 
    via 
        obfuscation











        
Complexity abounds:
    Data structures, 
        wrapped in classes are complex.
    Syntax is complex.
    Positional arguments to statements are complex
    Looping is complex
        nested looping is even more complex;
    ORM is OMG complex.
    Messaging objects for their contents is complex.
        and probablistic 
    Call chaining is Chaining complexities.
    Null defense strategies are verbosity in the face of complexity
    Order and sequence are stateful by themselves
    Monitoring a myriad of objects for continual change = super complex.

It's manageable on one core with serial processes.

But what about multicores?
