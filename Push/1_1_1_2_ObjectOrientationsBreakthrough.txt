Procedural programming was all Stateful all the time.

Object orientation's  breakthrough
    was to cluster state into chunks

Messages communicating back-and-forth between chunks
    the cost = Complexity + Obfuscation 

Objects get bound-up by the procedures they absorb.

Objects can be promiscuous, 
    able to touch internal members 
    of other objects unconsented.

Inheritance was for specialization, 
    but we ended up over using it for code reuse!
